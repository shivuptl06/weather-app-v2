# Weather Dashboard Application

## Description

The Weather Dashboard Application is a responsive web application built using React and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to search for weather information by city, providing real-time data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The application utilizes the OpenWeather API for weather data and the Unsplash API to refresh background images based on the weather.

## Features

- **City Search**: Users can input the name of a city to retrieve weather information. The app suggests cities based on user input for easier selection.
- **Weather Data**: Displays current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with corresponding icons.
- **Dynamic Background**: Changes the background image based on the weather condition using the Unsplash API.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **APIs**: OpenWeather API, Unsplash API
- **Deployment**: Vercel, Netlify
- **State Management**: React hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Learning Outcomes
