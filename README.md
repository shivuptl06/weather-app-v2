# Weather Dashboard Application

## Description

The Weather Dashboard Application is a responsive web application built using React and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to search for weather information by city, providing real-time data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions. The application utilizes the OpenWeather API for weather data and the Unsplash API to refresh background images based on the weather.

## Features

- **City Search**: Users can input the name of a city to retrieve weather information. The app suggests cities based on user input for easier selection.
- **Weather Data**: Displays current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with corresponding icons.
- **Dynamic Background**: Changes the background image based on the weather condition using the Unsplash API.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and works seamlessly on various devices.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Tailwind CSS
- **APIs**: OpenWeather API, Unsplash API
- **Deployment**: Vercel, Netlify
- **State Management**: React hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS

## Learning Outcomes

During the development of this project, I learned:

- API integration with OpenWeather for geolocation (fetching latitude and longitude) and weather data.
- Using Postman to test API requests.
- Deployment of the application on platforms like Vercel and Netlify.
- Implementation of the react-select library for better user experience.
- How to hide API keys using `.env` files to enhance security.

## Deployment

The Weather Dashboard Application is deployed on both Vercel and Netlify. You can check out the live project and see it in action:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
